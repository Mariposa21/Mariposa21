I work as a proud bilingual, female Software Engineer. <br> 
I love solving puzzles with C#, Python, & T-SQL. ETL/ELT processing, legacy code migrations, APIs, Azure cloud development and all things data-related are my greatest strengths. <br>
When I'm not programming, I'm either traveling or living out my dream as a nature-loving bookworm. <br>

And thanks for stopping by! <br>
